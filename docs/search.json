According to a 2015 World Bank report, around 2.5 billion people globally are covered by safety nets, through which 36 percent of the very poor have managed to escape extreme poverty.\nKey Questions:\n\nHow can safety nets be designed which serve both vast rural populations and the rising urban poor?\nHow can we ensure these schemes are not subjected to errors of targeting when catering to large and diverse populations?\nAre these schemes a palliative cure or a tool for furthering India towards long-term resilient development?\nHow does politics influence the idea of welfare in India?\nIs there sufficient state capacity to bring about improved governance and institutional reforms?\n\nOur Approach:\nWe study the success and failures of India’s social safety net system in terms of three aspects: scope, form, and focus. By scope, we mean the objectives of safety net programs; focus refers to the beneficiaries; and form refers to the modality or design. After deliberating upon the achievements and limitations of various welfare programs, this book looks ahead and highlights key challenges and scope for innovations in designing a future social safety net system for a rising India."
